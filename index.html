       The <span>poem</span> is the consequence of its <span>origin</span> Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. But it is a <span> growing</span> damp and I must go in. <span>Memories</span> fog is rising. Among Emily Dickinsons last words in a <span>letter</span> A woman whom <span> everyone </span> thought of as shut-in, homebound, cloistered, spoke as if she had been out, <span>exploring</span> the earth, her whole <span>life</span>, and it was finally time to go in. And it was.
